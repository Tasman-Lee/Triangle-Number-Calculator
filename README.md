The Python code committed is a calculator program that calculates the sum of the triangle numbers in an array list. This program is capable of:
  - Removing duplicating numbers in the array list
  - Identify if the numbers in the array are triangle numbers
  - Calculate the sum of the triangle numbers in the array list

The formula of triangle numbers:
- Triangle numbers are a sequence of numbers that a triangle arrangement of objects can represent. The **nth** term, are denoted as **T(n)** and is the sum of the first n natural numbers.
